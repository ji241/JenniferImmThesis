This repository contains the code used throughout my thesis, entitled, "exploring the epigenome of neurons and glia *in vitro* to determine
their utility as a model for Alzheimer's disease".

Within my thesis there are four data chapters which required analysis using bioinformatics, those chapters are:

**Chapter 3** - Determining protein level changes throughout induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) differentiation into neurons

**Chapter 4** - Characterising the epigenetic changes occuring throughout iPSC differentiation into neurons

**Chpater 5** - Characterising the epigenetic changes occuring when iPSC-derived neurons and iPSC-derived microglia are treated with different epigenetic modulators

**Chapter 6** - Characaterising the epigenetic changes occuring when a microglial cell line is treated with lipopolysaccharide
  
The name of each script in this repository starts with the chapter it was used in followed by a description of the analysis it contains,
*e.g.* quality control (QC), Immunocytochemistry (ICC) quantification etc.
